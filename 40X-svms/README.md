_Author:_ Timothy Book, General Assembly DC

This is the repository for the Support Vector Machines (SVM) minitopic.

### Agenda (~1 hour):
1. **Motivation**: What motivates the need for an SVM?
1. **Historical Success**: The rise and fall and rise again(?) of SVMs in modern data science.
1. **Geometry**: What do SVMs do geometrically?
1. **Under the hood**: How are SVMs fit?
1. **Example 1**: Fit a linear SVM classifier.
1. **Kernels**: What are kernels? What is the "kernel trick"?
1. **Example 2**: Fit a kernelized SVM classifier.
