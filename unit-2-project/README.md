## Due Date
Project 2 is due **Monday, August 14th at midnight**.

## Project Objectives
For this project, you will be conducting basic exploratory data analysis, practicing your data analysis skills while becoming comfortable with Python (Pandas not required, but pretty much essential).

This project contains **two** parts. You must complete **both** for full credit.

### Part 1: 
Using your new Python skills, complete a series of guided prompts exploring [the top-rated movies on IMDB](./data/imdb_1000.csv). IMDB stands for "the Internet Movie Database," an online collection of film information and reviews.
 
In these exercises, students will be looking to answer such questions as: 

- What is the average rating per genre?
- How many different actors are in a movie?

The IMDB dataset provided is created from data scraped from the [Internet Movie Database website](https://www.imdb.com). The dataset describes top ranking movies, including: title, data, duration, content rating, headlining actors, and ranking.


### Part 2: 
Using Python, conduct some exploratory data analysis on Chipotle's order data. You will be looking to answer such questions as: 

  - How many orders are being made?
  - What is the average price per order?
  - How many different ingredients? 

The Chipotle data set is taken from "The Upshot" column in The New York Times. It was chosen because the data is from a familiar source representing real world consumer transaction data - plus their guacamole is delicious. 

This dataset was analyzed in-depth by [data scientists from the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/02/17/upshot/what-do-people-actually-order-at-chipotle.html). We have modified our questions based on their analysis, but we encourage students **not** to review their analysis until **after** they have made their own attempt.

## Project Requirements

In a Jupyter Notebook, create working solutions for all of the **required** questions for the Option you've chosen. Your notebook should include:

1. Text for each question, copy and pasted from the starter-code provided.
2. A working solution to each problem.
   - Do not include test, practice, or broken code (*unless you were unable to create a working solution*).
3. Comments for all of your code.
   - In your comments, describe any assumptions you made in order to solve these problems.

4. **Optional**: After completing the required portions, try your hand at the other option or complete the **bonus** sections for an additional challenge!

## Rubric

For all projects, requirements will be evaluated on a simple point scale of 0, 1, or 2. Additionally, instructors will provide you with feedback on required portions of your project.

Score | Expectations
:--- | :---
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _You gave a solid effort, but the code does not run and/or yield correct results._
**2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
**2** | _Code runs and the correct answer is given. Good job!_
**3** | _Code achieves its task in a way that is easier, faster, or more efficient than what you might have done given the material taught in class.  Wow!_

> Note: Scores of `2` mean that a requirement has been completely fulfilled, while `3` is typically reserved for bonus objectives.

## Submission

To submit your project, simply have a forked version of this repo on your own GHE page filled out with your answers. IAs will clone this repository and grade on their own machines.
