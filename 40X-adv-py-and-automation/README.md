_Author:_ Timothy Book, General Assembly DC

This is the repository for the "minitopic" about some advanced Python skills and how to automate your life. The focus is on automation via Python _scripting_, as opposed to using Jupyter Notebooks to do data analysis. 

### Agenda (~1 hour):
1. **The Command Line**
	* Executing Python from the CL
	* Creating executables via the hashbang (#!)
	* Changing executable permission (if necessary)
	* Placement of CL scripts, and the $PATH variable
1. **Command line arguments and f-strings**
1. **OOP and Bitcoin Example**
1. **Automation of email alerts via SMTP**
